scripts for Intro/Admin course

Download file to your PC. Using Ubuntu (or something similar), type "./manual-cleanup-v3.sh" (obviously don't type the quotation marks). Then follow the prompts.

Note that this script is designed to delete the objects created for the Intro/Admin course. So it does not delete, for example, Shared Policies created in the WAAP course.
